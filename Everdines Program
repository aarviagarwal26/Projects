# Everdine's Program
# This program will calculate the total for an order of grilled cheese sandwiches from Everdine's
# 1. Store the customer's name
# 2. Store the cost of a drink, chips, and sandwich
# 3. Set the total cost to 0
# 4. Print the Everdine's menu
# 5. Ask the user how many sandwiches they want to order
# 6. Ask the user what sandwich they want for their order
# 7. If the users wants chips with their order, add the chip cost to the total
# 8. If the user wants a drink with their order, add the drink cost to the total
# 9. Repeat steps 6-8 from 0 up to the number of sandwiches ordered
# 10. Multiply the number of sandwiches ordered by the sandwich cost and add it to the total
# 11. If the customer's name is Eddie and they ordered an Eddie Mack & Cheese, they get it for free
# 12. Multiply the tax rate (1.75%) times the total to figure out the amount of tax owed
# 13. Add the tax owed to the total and output the total amount for the order
