#Counting the Votes

#Ask the user to input the number of votes in a single district for your candidate or -1 if they have entered all of the districts. 
#Use a while loop to repeat the process.
#Add an accumulator variable to keep track of the total number of votes.
#Add a counter variable to count the number of districts entered.
#Display the total number of votes the candidate received.
#Calculate and display the average number of votes per district for your candidate.

district = 1
vtotal = 0

while votes > 0:
  district += 1
  vtotal += votes
  votes = int(input("\nHow many votes were recieved in district {}? (Enter -1 to exit.)".format(district)))
