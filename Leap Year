#Leap Year

#Rules: 
#1. Divisible by 4
#2. If the year IS divisible by 100, then divide by 400.
#3. If the year is NOT divisible by 100, and IS divisible by 4, then it IS a leap year.

#Step 1: Have the user enter a year
#Step 2: If the year is divisible by 4, continue to step 3, else the year is NOT a leap year
#Step 3: If the year is divisible by 100, continue to step 4, else the year IS a leap year
#Step 4: If the year is divisible by 400, it IS a leap year, else it is NOT a leay year.

print("Welcome to the Leap Year Program! Enter your year to know whether or not if it's a leap year!")
print()

#Step 1:
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
print()

# The % is modulus. It gives you the remainder of division
#Checking if the remainder is 0, meaning the year is evenly divisible by 4
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print(str(year)+" is a leap year.")
    else:
       print(str(year)+" is not a leap year.")
  else:
     print(str(year)+" is a leap year.")
else:
   print(str(year)+" is a not leap year.")
